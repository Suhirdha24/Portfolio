            <!-- Project 1 -->
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a machine learning model using <strong>Random Forest</strong> and <strong>SVM</strong> to predict multiple diseases, 
                    including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The project involved collecting and cleaning healthcare data, training the 
                    model, and evaluating its performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. I also visualized the results using 
                    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>, helping healthcare professionals with early diagnosis decisions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 2 -->
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Wildfire Prediction using Deep Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Built a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> model using <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Keras</strong> to predict 
                    the presence of wildfire in images taken from remote areas. The system analyzes real-time satellite and drone imagery 
                    to detect early signs of fires. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and deployment, which could 
                    potentially save lives by providing real-time alerts to firefighters and authorities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Project 3 -->
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Smart Parking System using YOLO</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented a <strong>real-time parking detection system</strong> using the <strong>YOLOv8</strong> algorithm, designed to 
                    automatically detect available parking spaces in urban areas by analyzing live video feeds from surveillance cameras. 
                    The project integrates computer vision techniques with real-time data processing to ease the burden of finding parking 
                    in crowded cities. The system is able to predict open spots with high accuracy and provide dynamic availability updates to users.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Competency Score Calculator:</strong> Evaluates resumes by checking for specific keywords and qualifications using 
                        a Hugging Face model. This project aimed at automating the recruitment process by scoring resumes based on job description 
                        matching, saving time for HR professionals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>IPL Dashboard Analysis using PowerBI:</strong> Analyzed IPL data and visualized player performance metrics such as runs, 
                        wickets, and strike rates. The interactive dashboard allows coaches and analysts to make data-driven decisions by comparing 
                        players and match statistics across different seasons.
